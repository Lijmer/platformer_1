Every level needs 4 sections: 'properties', 'images', 'sounds', 'map'. To start a section put the section name between '[' and ']'. To end a section put a ';' on a new line.
The content of the section needs to be seperated with a new line.
You can make comments by putting '//'. Everything after the '//' won't be read. If the '//' is put at the beginning of a line, it won't even read the new line.


[properties]
The properties section can have the following content in the following style

tileWidth = #value
tileHeight = #value

Every propertie needs to be on a new line. The spaces at the '=' sign are necessary.


[images]
The images section consists out of a single line with image ID's in the following style

#value,#vaule,#value,

Every value ends with a comma to seperate them. Spaces are illegal.

[map]
This is basicly the lay out of the level with object ID's. Every ID has its own object. Object ID's are seperated with a ' '. It is recommended to use a '|' if it is also the end of the screen, this is just to make reading the file easier for the user. It is also recommended to put a series of '--' add the bottom of every screen, this alo makes reading the file easier for the user.

-2	obj_menu_button
